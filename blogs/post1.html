			<h1>Device Overview</h1>
			<img src="/files/images/spark7pinhand.jpg" alt="Tecno Spark 7P">
			<p>The Tecno Spark 7P is a low tier Mid Range device offered by Tecno officially released April of 2021 featuring Android 11 Based on HiOS 7.6. The device is somewhat basic yet filled with potential. The device has a plastic body, a relatively thick bezel at the bottom of the screen and a less thick bezel at the top. The device has an Infinity "V" notch and is an IPS LCD display peaking at 90hz. The Maximum Brightness value was stated but the display is 'Average' under extreme sunlight. It has acceptable audio quality with dual speakers 'DIRAC' sound system giving som level of 3D surround sound. The camera is fair, although the Traditional Transsion camera heavily compresses pictures with massive color loss and almost no HDR even with the 'HDR' option enabled. This HDR feature can't be used at the user's will as the only options available are 'Auto' and 'Off' making it a pain to take portraits while having completely white sky regardless of the clouds present at the time. You could compensate and lock the Exposure then reducing the reducing the light effects, this option would result in much darker pictures for the subject of the photograph resulting in a poor photo quality.</p>

			<h2>Software</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/hios7.6.jpeg">
			<p>The Software of this device is very smooth, snappy and heavily complemented by the 90hz Display Refresh Rate to give a blazing fast experience. The OS is littered with Ads and bloatware. At first you could easily ignore them but later you begin to notice how intrusive these Ads can become, the Bloatware are Pre installed. Some can be uninstalled while most can only be disabled. These applications can be removed through another alternative but only at USER-LEVEL and not from the device core system files. The software is relatively clean looking, a discouragingly basic quick settings menu.</p>

			<h2>The Camera</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/camera.jpeg">
			<p>The Camera of the Tecno Spark 7P are special yet vulnerable. The photo quality from the camera sensor stands out when put to the test, outperforming even 50MP devices from other Manufacturers. The camera setup of the Tecno Spark 7P features triple camera setup and a signle front facing camera with 4 LED Flashlights. Details down below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rear Camera 1 (Main): @1080p 16MP f/1.8 27mm Video Recording(720p, 1080p, 2k) @30fps</li>
				<li>Rear Camera 2 (Depth): 2MP f/2.4 22mm</li>
				<li>Rear Camera 3 (Ultra Wide): 2MP f/2.4 22mm</li>
				<li>Front Camera 1 (Selfie): 8MP f/2.0 25mm Video Recording(720p, 1080p, 2k) @30fps</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Video recording quality at 2k is fairly better in clarity compared to 1080p. The Video 2k resolution is only usable with Transsion's system Camera application. The Main camera is the only accessible/usable sensor as the other 2 are unavailable to the user by DEFAULT. I was able to get the 3rd Sensor running but was disappointed to discover the viewfinder and the end result photograph were only shown in Black and White. i have absolutely no idea why this is so, but the bright side is the fact that it's an Ultra Wide sensor limited to 2MP. Image results would look acceptable under sufficient lighting e.g. A Sunny Day. So it is without a doubt that the device has Auxilary Lenses (We can't say much about the depth sensor as depth sensors aren't realy meant to be used by the consumer/end-user.</p>
			<p>Below is a sample image of the neglected Ultra Wide sensor</p>
			<img src="/files/images/ultrawideshot1.jpg">
			<p>For comparison, here is a shot from the Main sensor</p>
			<img src="/files/images/mainshot1.jpg">
			<p>With Close observation, you'll notice much more captured in the first image, at f/2.4 it's pretty wide to me</p>
			<p>Below is an image showing the auxilary sensor values for Main (1x) and UltraWide (0.8x).</p>
			<img src="/files/images/ultrawideshot2.jpg">
			<p>The Camera resolution is too low to carry on using it with the Black and White, as a result the sensor is still not as useful.</p>
			<p>The 8MP Selfie Camera is very decent with very detailed photographs and above average portraits</p>

			<div id="soundandspeakers">
			<h2>Sound and Speakers</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/dirac1.jpg">
			<p>The Tecno Spark 7P contains a Dual Speaker setup featuring the Dirac Stereo Sound Effectsystem. This effect is great on paper but not as practical. Given the top speaker is combined with the 'ear speaker'. As a result, the Audio quality is richer but lower in volume, on the other side, the bottom speakers are loud but lack depth. This results in more sound coming from either direction (phone could be flipped left or right) reducing the "3D Surround Sound Effect". This doesn't mean the speaker sound quality is bad, just not as advertised.</p>

			<div id="thedisplay">
			<h2>The Display</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/display1.jpg">
			<p>The Tecno Spark 7P Display is a 6.8" inch IPS LCD Display with 2 refresh modes (@60hz/fps and @90hz/fps) with a resolution of 720p (1640x720). It's display is, in my opinion the best LCD display i have used in recent times. It offers a 'True Tone-like' experience having Deeper Blacks and Brighter but evenly saturated colors. This makes pictures look almost +30% better in color appreciation. At most times, you'll notice the resolution (720p) isn't the sharpest but it is relatively vivid.</p>

			<div id="thechipset">
			<h2>The Chipset</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/heliog70.jpg">
			<p>Ahh yes, the Chipset, What else makes this device stand out? The Helio G70 (MT6769) is one of the best Mediatek Chipsets for balancing out Performance and Battery Life. The Chip does excellently well on battery standby. The Chipset details are below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Octa Core - 2 Clusters: Cluster 1= 1700mhz X6 Cortex-A55 and Cluster 2= 2000mhz X2 Cortex-A75. (6 Efficiency cores and 2 Performance cores)</li>
				<li>12nm</li>
				<li>architecture ARMv8 arm64-v8a (64-bit)</li>
				<li>CPU Governor: Schedutil</li>
				<li>GPU: Mali-G52 MC2</li>
				<li>GPU: Architecture: Bifrost</li>
				<li>GPU: Vulkan Support (API Version 1.1)</li>
				<li>Memory: 4GB (3.96GB typical) RAM LPDDR4X Dual Channel</li>
				<li>Storage: 64GB EMMC 5.1</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Chip performs relatively well in high end games while maintaining stable performance and average thermal management.</p>
