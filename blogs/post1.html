			<h1>The Device Overview</h1>
			<img src="/files/images/spark7pinhand.jpg" alt="Tecno Spark 7P">
			<p>The Tecno Spark 7P is a low tier Mid Range device offered by Tecno officially released April of 2021 featuring Android 11 Based on HiOS 7.6. The device is somewhat basic yet filled with potential. The device has a plastic body, a relatively thick bezel at the bottom of the screen and a less thick bezel at the top. The device has an Infinity "V" notch and is an IPS LCD display peaking at 90hz. The Maximum Brightness value was stated but the display is 'Average' under extreme sunlight. It has acceptable audio quality with dual speakers 'DIRAC' sound system giving som level of 3D surround sound. The camera is fair, although the Traditional Transsion camera heavily compresses pictures with massive color loss and almost no HDR even with the 'HDR' option enabled. This HDR feature can't be used at the user's will as the only options available are 'Auto' and 'Off' making it a pain to take portraits while having completely white sky regardless of the clouds present at the time. You could compensate and lock the Exposure then reducing the reducing the light effects, this option would result in much darker pictures for the subject of the photographresulting in a poor photo quality.</p>
			
			<h2>The Software</h2>
			<img src="/files/images/hios7.6.jpeg">
			<p>The Software of this device is very smooth, snappy and heavily complemented by the 90hz Display Refresh Rate to give a blazing fast experience. The OS is littered with Ads and bloatware. At first you could easily ignore them but later you begin to notice how intrusive these Ads can become, the Bloatware are Pre installed. Some can be uninstalled while most can only be disabled. These applications can be removed through another alternative but only at USER-LEVEL and not from the device core system files. The software is relativelt clean looking, an almost discouragingly basic quick settings menu and a chronic white background which could be unfriendly to the Eye.</p>
